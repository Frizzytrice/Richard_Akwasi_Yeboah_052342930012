                <p style="color: white;"><b>“Dirty Diana”</b> is the 5th single (and 5th #1 song) from Michael’s 1987 album Bad, which sees him tackle the issue of groupies in a more aggressive, palpable way than he did on “Billie Jean”, accompanied by a scathing guitar riff a la “Beat It” (featuring guitarist Steve Stevens).

                    On the song, in an interview in 1987 Michael said:
                    
                        <i>I love Dirty Diana, it’s one of my favorites. It’s a life story of a groupie – I hate to say the word groupie, but that’s what it is – and it’s something that I’ve experienced, and a lot of people that grow up on the road [experience].</i>
                    
                    On a visit to Wembley during his Bad World Tour in 1988, Michael took this song out of the lineup in deference to Princess Diana. It was previously thought that the song was not performed that night, but it was in fact added back into the set list shortly after hearing that it was one of her favorite songs.
                    
                    The Weeknd covered this song on his 2011 mixtape Echoes of Silence.</p>

                    (Oh, no)
                    (Oh, no, no)
                    
                <li>[Verse 1]</li>
                    You'll never make me stay
                    So take your weight off of me
                    I know your every move
                    So won't you just let me be?
                    I've been here times before
                    But I was too blind to see
                    That you seduce every man
                    This time, you won't seduce me
                    
                <li>[Pre-Chorus]</li>
                    She's saying "That's okay
                    Hey, baby, do what you please
                    I have the stuff that you want
                    I am the thing that you need"
                    She looked me deep in the eyes
                    She's touching me so to start
                    She says "There's no turning back"
                    She trapped me in her heart

                    She likes the boys in the band
                    She knows when they come to town
                    Every musician's fan
                    After the curtain comes down
                    She waits at backstage doors
                    For those who have prestige
                    Who promise fortune and fame
                    A life that's so carefree
                    
                <li>[Pre-Chorus]</li>
                    She's saying "That's okay
                    Hey, baby, do what you want
                    I'll be your night-loving thing
                    I'll be the freak you can taunt
                    And I don't care what you say
                    I want to go too far
                    I'll be your everything
                    If you make me a star"

                    She said "I have to go home
                    'Cause I'm real tired, you see
                    But I hate sleeping alone
                    Why don't you come with me?"
                    I said "My baby's at home
                    She's probably worried tonight
                    I didn't call on the phone
                    To say that I'm alright"

                    Diana walked up to me
                    She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
                    At that, I ran to the phone
                    Saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
                    I said "But unlock the door
                    'Cause I forgot the key"
                    She said "He's not coming back
                    Because he's sleeping with me"
                    [Chorus]
